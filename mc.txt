Your job is to get a minecraft workspace to work inside Open Agent. By this I mean being able to start a Mission where
Sisyphus (the default agent) has access to an isolated workspace you have created, where shard launcher CLI is installed 
(see https://github.com/Th0rgal/shard/releases/tag/v0.1.14), and there is a profile in 1.21.11 with MC-CLI installed
(see https://github.com/Th0rgal/mc-cli). You may check my local shard configuration on this computer to import my minecraft
account session tokens. On this session, the agent would use the desktop MCP to start a desktop, then start Minecraft on
it, connect to the minecraft server demo.oraxen.com, and share screenshots.

You will do so using playwright and ensure the UI/UX is good. You will take screenshots regularly and also ensure that the 
desktop is visible, and you can indeed see Minecraft. You may create many workspaces until it works (using the ubuntu template),
you will also fix any bugs you find along the way, and find improvements that could be done to make the process better.
You may edit the skills enabled in the workspace, edit the skills directly, etc.

Deploy the backend on remote server (root@95.216.112.253), the test nextjs website is already running on port 3001 (for testing with playwright).
You will probably need to redeploy many times (after each fix), to be able to test that it works.
